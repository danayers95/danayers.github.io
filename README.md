This account is a collection of all my coding projects, both past and present!
This repository is meant to show off my coding skills as I get back into the hang of coding. 
I created a repository on my GitHub account, and then downloaded GitHub desktop, so that I could download the repository onto my local machine. Then I edited the README with this information, and finally I commited the changes to my repository.
