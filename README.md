- This account is a collection of all my coding projects, *both* **past and present**!
- This repository is meant to show off my coding skills as I get back into the hang of coding. 
- I created a repository on my GitHub account, and then downloaded GitHub desktop, so that I could download the repository onto my local machine. Then I edited the README with this information, and finally I commited the changes to my repository. 

# About Me
## Background
I was born in Ottawa Canada, but have lived most of my life in Raleigh, North Carolina. I first learned how to code when I took a 6 month full-stack web development bootcamp with UNC Chapel Hill, which started with showing us how to code in **HTML**, but by the end of the course we were creating full applications in *React*.

## My Interests 
In my free time, I like to play the drums, read, or spend time with my cat. I'm also trying to teach myself how to code simple little video games in my free time!
